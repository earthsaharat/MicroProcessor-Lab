## Content

There are topics of my works

### Week 1 - Arduino Register
[go to Week1](https://github.com/earthsaharat/MicroProcessor-Lab/tree/master/Week1)

### Week 2 - IC 8-Bit Shift Registers

IC 74HC595 - 8-Bit Serial-In, Parallel-Out Shift

### Week 4 - 7-Segment display

A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimalnumerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays. Seven-segment displaysare widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, basic calculators, and other electronicdevices that display numerical information.

### Week 5 - SPI and 7-Segment

Serial  Peripheral  Interface  (SPI)  is  a  synchronous  serial  data  protocol  used  by microcontrollers  for communicating  with  one  or  more  peripheral  devices  quickly  over  short distances. It can also be used for communication between two microcontrollers.

### Week 6 - I2C - Real Time Clock (RTC)

I2C combines the best features of SPI and UARTs. With I2C, you canconnect multiple slaves to a single master (like SPI) and you can have multiple masters controlling single, or multiple slaves. This isreally useful when you want to have more than one microcontroller.

real-time clock (RTC) is a low-power, full binary-coded decimal (BCD) clock/calendar plus 56 bytes of NV SRAM. Address and data are transferred serially through an I²C.

### Week 7 - I2C - OLED

### Week 8 - UART - Software Serial

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It’s not a communicationprotocol like SPI and I2C, but a  physical circuit in a microcontroller, or a stand-alone IC. AUART’s main purpose is to transmit and receive serial data.

[go to Week8](https://github.com/earthsaharat/MicroProcessor-Lab/tree/master/Week8)

### Week 9 - Interrupt

An Interrupt's job is to make sure that the processor responds quickly to important events. When a certain signal is detected, an Interrupt (as the name suggests) interrupts whatever the processor is doing, and executes some code designed to react to whatever external stimulus is being fed to the Arduino.

### Week 10 - Encoder and Motor with interrupt

A motor encoder is a rotary encoder mounted to an electric motor that provides closed loop feedback signals by tracking the speed and/or position of a motor shaft.

[go to Week10](https://github.com/earthsaharat/MicroProcessor-Lab/tree/master/Week10)

### Week 11 - PID Control

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.

[go to Week11](https://github.com/earthsaharat/MicroProcessor-Lab/tree/master/Week11)

### Week 12 - Speed Control

Control the speed of motor. Read the speed back using encoder and calculate pluse to RPM.
